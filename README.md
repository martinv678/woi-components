# The Woi vision

What?! Another component library? Yeah you heard, another one. But where others have failed Neo, Woi will succeed. Woi will be a library of everyday components for UI development. This should save you / me hours, because do we really need a billion accordions and carousels... no.

Each components is meant to be a starting block to copy and paste into your project. I floated the idea of this on Reddit and people start crying "but my button might need rounded edges and yours may not have them", well just add rounded edges. Add your own click events. Do what the f$%! you need to for your project but for the love of God / Allah / Buddha / Anunnaki please don't start fresh as 100% what you need to build has been built before.

I am not precious, everything is rough right now and this is just an idea. I want this to be community lead, I have 2 kids so time is short. I'd love to see people dumping their killer components in here. Got something in Angular cool drop it in. Have a nice little React components, great let's see that sh!t!.

Talking about code? How about utils while we're at it, drop these in.

The goal is to stop us repeating ourselves as we don't have much time left, ChatGPT is after our jobs and she doesn't sleep.
