# Woi Components - Manifesto

## Introduction

Welcome to Woi Components, a component library designed to save thousands of hours of dev time. Our mission is to eliminate redundant coding efforts by offering a huge suite of reusable Vanilla Web Components and JS Library & Framework components that act as a base for your components.

This library is not just a tool; it's a movement towards more efficient, shared development.

## Vision

Our vision is a world where developers collaborate to create a universally accessible set of UI components. We're not just building a library; we're cultivating a community where every member contributes to the evolution of web development practices.

## Core Principles

1. **Reusability and Efficiency:** Components will be designed for maximum reusability, ensuring efficient and consistent development workflows.
2. **Customizability:** Flexible components that adapt to various design systems and project requirements.
3. **Community-Driven:** A library powered by a diverse community of developers, embracing collaborative growth and innovation.
4. **Performance and Accessibility:** High-performing, accessible components for an inclusive user experience.
5. **Simplicity in Design:** Focusing on intuitive interfaces and clear documentation for an enjoyable development experience.

## Community Contributions

### Submitting Your Components

-   **Open to All:** Anyone can contribute their components. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer, your contributions are valuable to us.
-   **Guidelines and Standards:** We provide clear guidelines for component submission to maintain quality and consistency. Ensure your components meet our standards in terms of performance, accessibility, and reusability.
-   **Review Process:** Submitted components go through a community-led review process, ensuring that only the best make it to the library.

### Collaborative Development

-   **Beyond a Core Team:** While we have a dedicated team to maintain the library, we believe the true potential lies in community collaboration.
-   **Community Governance:** Decisions about new features, major changes, and roadmap priorities are made through open community discussions and consensus.
-   **Active Participation:** We encourage active involvement from the community in all aspects - from contributing code to decision-making and support.

## What to Expect

We expect that this library will not be a one size fits all approach. It can never be, everyone has different standard and expectations. What this is a starting block which you can then edit and adapt to your needs.

There could be multiple versions of the same component, and it's up to you as the developer to choose which fits your need the best.
